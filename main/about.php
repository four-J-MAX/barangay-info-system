      <div>
        <center><img src="../img/tugas_logo.png" style=" width: 200px; height: 200px;  "></center> <br>
        <p style=" float: right; text-align: justify;">The pearl of the Orient seas surely has a history that is a
          cornucopia of enchanting myths and legends, and it would seem that Barangay Tugas is no exception blend with
          these stories of corsairs ages ago who gets into voyages in the hope of finding treasures as they venture in
          the unknown, and you’ll surely have some worthwhile tales to read on.
          <br>
          Like most histories of places in the Philippines, our Barangay has also been a fruit of humanity’s need for a
          wider territory back in the days when societies are just beginning to form.
          <br>
          Moreover, the name of the Barangay itself has a variety of supposed legendary behind it. And though confusions
          are most of the time impossible to clear when dealing with the past, let us just appreciate the fact that we
          have these diverse tales which are all equally rich and meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>The legendary story tells, that before the island of Bantayan was discover, there are already a group of
          native people who are existing in this place, and it was lead by a powerful, brave, strongest warrior named
          Tugas, the day that they attack by bandage people lead by lunok, he was given a sword by a mystical lady, but
          unfortunately he was killed. His body buried by some of his villagers. As time goes on they were surprise that
          there is a tree growing in the place where the body of Tugas buried. Later on it grows and found abundantly in
          this place, and they called the tree “Tugas” (Molave).
          <br>
          The Barangay has a large share of many hardwood trees, the wood is valued for its fine grain and durability.
          It is useful for tool hardles, for posts, and jambs of the house and for prows or pamawong of small Barangay
          Tarong, Barangay Pili, Barangay Malbago, and Barangay Mancilang. They made an agreement to give a portion of
          there land area in order to create another Barangay wayback 1986.
          <br>
          Barangay Tugas is one of the fast progressive Barangay under the municipal government of Madridejos. A3rd
          class municipality in the province of Cebu , Region 7.
          <br>
          Based on the 2018 Comelec Records, the Barangay has 2,270 registered voter and counting; 1130 are males and
          1140 are females and has 5 clustered precincts.
